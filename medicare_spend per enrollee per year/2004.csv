"Notes"
"Data reflect Medicare spending on personal health care services and products (hospital care, physician services, nursing home care, prescription drugs, etc.) by state of residence. State of residence estimates account for the flow of individuals between states in order to consume health care services and present health spending based on where individuals reside rather than where they receive care."
