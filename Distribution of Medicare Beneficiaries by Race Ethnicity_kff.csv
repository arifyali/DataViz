"Notes"
"The ASEC asks respondents about their health insurance coverage throughout the previous calendar year. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. A person reporting having Medicare coverage and another type of coverage during the year would be categorized as having Medicare coverage in this analysis."

"Data may not sum to totals due to rounding and data quality issues."

"Sources"

"Definitions"
"*Medicare*: Includes those covered by Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and those with Medicare and another type of coverage, such as dual eligibles who are also covered by Medicaid."
""
"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; all other racial/ethnic groups are non-Hispanic. "
""
"*Other*: Includes Asians, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Aleutians, Eskimos and persons of ""Two or More Races"". These groups have been combined due to their small populations in many states which prevent meaningful statistical analyses of the groups individually."
